HOW TO TOGGLE MAINTENANCE MODE:

1. To ENABLE maintenance mode:
   - Set environment variable: MAINTENANCE_MODE=1
   
   For local development:
   - Windows (PowerShell): $env:MAINTENANCE_MODE="1"; npm run dev
   - Windows (CMD): set MAINTENANCE_MODE=1 && npm run dev
   - Linux/Mac: MAINTENANCE_MODE=1 npm run dev
   
   For production:
   - Add to your .env file: MAINTENANCE_MODE=1
   - Or set in your hosting platform's environment variables: MAINTENANCE_MODE=1
   - Restart your application server

2. To DISABLE maintenance mode:
   - Unset the variable or set it to anything other than "1"
   
   For local development:
   - Windows (PowerShell): $env:MAINTENANCE_MODE="0"; npm run dev
   - Windows (CMD): set MAINTENANCE_MODE=0 && npm run dev
   - Linux/Mac: MAINTENANCE_MODE=0 npm run dev
   - Or simply: npm run dev (if not set, defaults to disabled)
   
   For production:
   - Remove MAINTENANCE_MODE from .env file OR set MAINTENANCE_MODE=0
   - Restart your application server

3. What happens when maintenance mode is enabled:
   - Top yellow banner appears: "Maintenance in progress..."
   - All Create Group buttons are disabled
   - All Join buttons are disabled
   - Chat input and send button are disabled
   - Toggle Group Status button is disabled
   - Leave Group button is disabled
   - All write API endpoints return HTTP 503 with message: "Maintenance in progress—please try again soon"
   - Users can still browse courses, groups, and view chat (read-only)

4. Testing:
   - Health check endpoint (/api/health) still works
   - Maintenance status endpoint (/api/maintenance-status) shows current status
